For my app I needed to set up a way for users to track weight, set a weight goal, adding the weight of their daily weight, and adding a way to access a database
and ask permission to use the phone to send an SMS message to users.

The three screens I used were a login screen, a screen that displayed the database and allowed users to add weights, and a screen that lets users change whether they
can receive notifications. My UI was easy to take in and had the buttons in spots that the eye would naturally be drawn to. I feel they were successful.

I coded the app piece by piece. I would work on one part of the UI, then affect the MainActivity page to make sure it had functionality. When I got stuck I would take
a break or I would look online to try and find the answer to whatever error I was having.

I checked the code was functional by comparing it to another project I had done previously that required me to access a database. It showed that having an API, DAO, and
other code involved in getting SQL inquiries has a great deal of overlap.

I had to find out how to create a MainActivity page in  android studio. Android studio seemed to lack as much as it provided so for every part of the process it made easy it
seemed to make something harder as well.

The previous project I used to access a database was very useful, although not having springboot made it more difficult.
